# Wordnet
Python 3

For the following words I have given my own definition and have compared each of them with their synset definitions in WordNet (comparison is just given by the number of matching words between the definitions):

1.politics

2.justice

3.food

4.patience.

The program takes a dictionary as an input where the key is the word and its value is the definition given by me. The definitions for the same words are taken from Wordnet and is compared with my definition. Comaprision is done using tokens from both definitions and common words excluding the stop words are printed.

WordNet is a large lexical database for English. Nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are grouped into sets of cognitive synonyms (“synsets”, i.e. synonim sets), each expressing a distinct concept. Synsets are interlinked by means of conceptual-semantic and lexical relations.
